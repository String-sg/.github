## Hi there 👋
We are String, a community of educators who:
**1) Simplify** EduTech and other emerging tech/ industry developments
**2) Scale** adopt and/or co-create EduTech products - you will find a couple here
**3) Structure** partnerships across stakeholders in education in both public and private sector
To build an ecosystem for educators (and wider public service) to partake in tech and innovate

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
